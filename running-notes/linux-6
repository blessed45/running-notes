                     LINUX 6 NOTES

All these while , we have been look some linux commands
we have learn how to create files, navigate directories and lot more

In our last class we saw how we can authorise a user to run task as the root user by assigning
sudoer access to the user
Today, we will continue to see hw task on the linux system with relative ease,
We started talking about user management and realise that when it comes to user management,

   User management includes;

   - creating groups
   - ctreating user's account
   - assign password to uses
   - add users to groups
   - modify user's account
   - delete a user
   - elevate user's privileges
   - re-set user's password
   - lock a user
   - set expiration date for user's account/password
   - assign task to users
   - grant and remove admin/sudo privileges

Creating user's account requires sudo/root privileges
We saw in our last class we can assign sudo privileges to a user

Now let see how we can assidn password to users
To do this, we all know that you must be authorise and we have already seen how to authorise a user
If you have sudo access, you can assign a password to a user
i.e
               sudo passwd username

the above command will permit you to assign a password to a user    

We can also create groups in the system and this also needs sudo access
i.e
               sudo groupadd groupname

         sudo groupadd group-A && sudo groupadd group-B && sudo groupadd group-c = task automation
                                  # you can use && or : to seperate the commands 

We can add users to groups
e,g
  a user's account is created and that user is an engineer, so, we have to add the user to the engineer's 
  group 
This is done by using the command known as 'usermod'
i.e
                sudo usermod -aG groupname username

the above command will add a user to a secondary group, secondary group because when a user is created in 
the system, the user comes with the user's home directory/users group

We can delete a user from the system and to do that you need sudo access 
this is done by the 'userdel' command
i.e
                sudo userdel username

note that this command will delete the user without the user's home dierctory

But if you want to delete a user with the user's /home directory, add the -c flag
i.e
               sudo -r userdel username

this will delete the user with the user's /home directory

Please take note of this command,
To delete a user's hone directory after the user have been deleted without the /home directory,
run the command;

                   sudo rm -rf /home/username

This will delete the user's home directory with relative ease

And to delete a user from a secondary group is what you should also take special note of.
To do that, run the command;

                  sudo gpasswd username groupname

Take note of the above command 

There is a file called /etc/group
So if you want to verify the number of groups existing, you cat the file
i.e
                  cat /etc/group

Now if you want to know a group that a user belongs to, there is a command called 'id'
run the command and it list all the groups that user belongs to
i.e
                 id username

DEMO
     illustrate series of examples

Elevate user's previlieges
For you to achieve this task, as we saw in our last class, we can;

                 sudo vi /etc/sudoers  
                 sudo visudo

either you vi in the file and modify it or you run the below commnd

                 sudo echo "username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/usernam
DEMO
     - demonstrate while explaining detailly for more understanding 
     - grant sudo access to some created users in the system or create new users and and assign 
       sudoers access to them
     - assign password to users 
     - switch from one user to another

Note at this juncture that , when a user is granted root/sudo access, that user can perform 
tasks/workload as the root user, 
i.e
   the user has elevated privileges and can now run tasks/workloads like;
   assigning password to users and any other task done with those privileges

DEMO
     switch to a user with elevated privileges and assign password to anothe user

To remove sudo access from users, vi into the /etc/sudoers file and modify the files
by deleting the user from the sudoers file

DEMO
     illustrate how to remove a user from the sudoers file

For example if someone is at work and not doing anything, what do you think we can do to that
type of a person? We can lock that person's account, and for us to do that, the command is;

                      sudo passwd -l username

to unlock back the account, we are going to run the command;

                      sudo -uf username

Take note that when you unlock a user's account, that uer's password will no longer exist,
so a new one will need to be created

To set expiring date for user's account/password
we all know that this are admin tasks, so sudo access is required
and the command is;

                     sudo chage username

DEMO
    illustrate while explaining all the parameters
    i.e
       minimum password age [0]:
       maximum password age [99999]:
       last password change (YYYY-MM-DD) [2023-08-31]:
       password expiration warning [7]: 10
       password inactive [-1]: 10
       Account Expiration Date (YYYY-MM-DD) [-1]:

So with this chage command, we can set some default value for a user

Now we have understood some basic user management commands


HOW CAN A USER ACCESS THE SERVER/EC2 INSTANCE EXTERNALLY USING PASSWORD
Take note of this, it's very important
 
For you to do that, the server must be configure such that it can be access externally
There two ways of doing that;

1) copy the follow two commands and paste;

                         sudo sed -i "/^[^#]*PasswordAuthentication[[:space:]]no/c\PasswordAuthentication yes"
                         sudo service sshd restart

OR

2)   We vi into a file called (/etc/ssh/sshd_config) and change passwd authentication = NO to passwd authentication = YES
after that, save and quite

                           vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

once you do that, restart the ssh service by running; 

                          sudo service sshd restart

this will finish confuring ur change

     Note that even with all credentials of a server;
i.e
      server ip-address
      username
      password 

You can not access the server externally, except it is the server has been configured
in such that it can be connected to externally

And note that when ever you do a change in the ssh service / configure a server, you
must restart the service, if you do not, the changes will not be executed by the server

I recomment for you to always use the first method of copying the two commnds and paste
because if you vi into that file and mess it up, you will not be able to log into that server 
again, either through ssh or password and/or externally
 
DENO
     - demonstrate with the vi command and run the 1) command


At this point, i think we are done with user management commands and don't worry, the cousre will
be deploy in such a way that everbody understand 

From here we will be looking at commands to know who is like connected to your system and what are
they doing and at what time they were connect, we are talking of commands that can be use to manage 
our system, known as system management commands or system resources management commands


                    SYSTEM MANAGEMENT COMMANDS 
 

To know who is connected to ur server and at what time the user got connected and where user is 
connecting from[ipaddress], we have a command called the 'who' command, when this command is runned
on the command line as;
                     
                        who
 
you will have a display like this below

                 username              date      time    ip-address(where)
               ec2-user pts/0        2023-06-24  10:30    (129.0.226.22)
               ec2-user pts/1        2023-06-24  11:18    (129.0.226.22)
               ec2-user pts/2        2023-06-24  11:44    (129.0.226.22)
               atango   pts/3        2023-06-24  12:21     (129.0.226.22)

DEMO
    - Diagramatical illustration of users connected to a server and performing task
    - assign password to a user in your system and ask users to connect to it and
    - run the 'who' command and expain for more clearity

we also have other commands like;


               wc = the word count command

 If you want to know if a user connected to the server is doing some work or not; we use the 'w' 
command
              w  = tells u how long ur server has been up and running, who is logged in and 
                   if the person is doing some work or not

To see/know the list of all users connected to the server, run the command;
           
               users 

And will list out a compact list of all users connected to the server           

DEMO
     Run all the commands bellow

             whereis = gives you where a command is found in your server 

             df -h = tells you hw much storage you have and hw much you are consuming

             du  -h = will tells you how much storage you have consume      

             date = use to check the date

             date [date time] = set the date of the server

             sudo timedatectl list-timezone = will list all the time zones

             sudo timedatectl set-timezone timezone = will set time zone

             sudo hostname  = wil show your hostname

             sudo hostname newname = will change you hostname

             sudo hostname set-hostname newname = sets the server hostname perminently

             ifconfig (or) hostname -i (or) ip -a  =  will display the private ipaddress of ur server
             curl ifconfig.co
